Overview
This Python script is a sophisticated, asynchronous subtitle translation tool designed to automatically translate subtitle files (SRT and ASS formats) from English to Turkish using multiple DeepLX API endpoints.

Key Features
1. Automatic Package Management
Checks and installs required Python libraries
Ensures all dependencies are available before script execution
2. Multi-API Translation Strategy
Supports multiple DeepLX API endpoints
Implements intelligent API selection mechanism
Tracks API performance and status
Handles API cooldowns and failures gracefully
3. Asynchronous Processing
Concurrent subtitle translation
Configurable translation concurrency limit
Efficient resource utilization
4. Comprehensive Logging
Error logging
Translation log tracking
Performance statistics recording
5. Subtitle Handling
Supports SRT and ASS subtitle formats
Handles various text encodings
Cleans subtitle text before translation
Preserves original subtitle timing and formatting
6. Progress Tracking
Real-time translation progress bar
Estimated time remaining
Detailed translation statistics
7. Translation Log Management
Prevents re-translation of processed files
Maintains a JSON log of translated files
Supports resumable translation process
Technical Highlights
Asynchronous programming with asyncio
Dynamic API endpoint management
Intelligent error handling
Flexible configuration options
Use Cases
Batch subtitle translation
Localization workflows
Media content internationalization
Requirements
Python 3.8+
Required libraries: httpx, pysrt, ass
Potential Improvements
Multi-language support
Advanced translation caching
More robust error recovery
Enhanced API provider integration
Usage
Simply run the script in a directory containing subtitle files. The script will automatically detect and translate .srt and .ass files from English to Turkish.
